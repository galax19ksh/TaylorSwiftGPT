# TaylorSwiftGPT
You are a Swiftie? If so, you have come to the right place! Ask anything about her and our friendly GPT who is the biggest Swiftie on the planet will give hit you right with the questions. 

TaylorSwiftGPT is a model implemented by finetuning a pretrained Pythia suite (LLM) released by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) with a taylor swift dataset from [Lamini](https://www.lamini.ai/). 

## Pretrained Model
EleutherAI's pretrained language model `pythia-70m` is used here as base model. It can be accessed from [here](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-70m)

## Finetuning Dataset
Lamini's finetune LLM dataset for Taylor Swift is used and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eyadgk/lamini-taylor-swift)

## Tools
Kaggle, pandas, PyTorch, Huggingface Transformers & TRL, PEFT (LoRA)

## Run it 
Please refer to the jupyter notebook in the repo. All codes are in it.

## Future Work
I only trained the model for TaylorSwiftGPT but right now couldn't build a frontend webpage for end to end deployment. I will work on it once I get time. Thank you so much for reading till the end!
